#PlayStore apps list

Chrome extension that let you create lists of apps in the playstore website and install them in a single click.

extension page in chrome webstore:  
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playstore-apps-list/dmkomfcjhhljhgignomcpehcdmmcfibc](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/playstore-apps-list/dmkomfcjhhljhgignomcpehcdmmcfibc)

The extension is working but have the bare minimum features.  
features i want to add in the future:  

- Support for multiple lists
- Import/export/share functionality  
- Code refactors & design changes

Feel free to report issues or feedback using the [github issues](https://github.com/Bnaya/playstore-apps-list/issues) or on the extension page
